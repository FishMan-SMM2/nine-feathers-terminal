Nine Feathers Terminal
A standalone, browser-based cipher and archive.
It hides what should be hidden, reveals what must be seen.

Encode or decode messages through the Feather Cipher.
Explore cryptic fragments buried in the archive.
Watch the Null Feather work — or refuse to work.
The interface may be simple.
The meaning is not.


“Some feathers carry words. Others carry silence.
Choose carefully which you pick up.”
